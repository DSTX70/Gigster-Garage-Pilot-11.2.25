Yep — those Replit steps are the right direction. Here’s the clean, “make it work” checklist I use when preview won’t open.

## Fix the Replit Preview (Gigster Garage: Express on 5000)

### 1) Ports / Networking panel

In **Networking / Ports**:

* **Delete** any existing entries for **3000** and **3001** (they can steal “primary preview”).
* Ensure **internal port `5000`** is mapped to **external `80`**.
* If you don’t see it, click **Open Port** and add:

  * **Internal:** `5000`
  * **External:** `80`

Then click **Open in new tab** (or whatever Replit calls the external link).

### 2) Use the “View preview” button in Checkpoints

If you see **“View preview”** in the **checkpoint section (bottom right)**, click that — it often opens the correct bound port directly (even when the regular preview pane is confused).

---

## The #1 cause: server isn’t actually listening on the right interface/port

Make sure your server binds like this (Express):

```ts
const port = Number(process.env.PORT ?? 5000);
app.listen(port, "0.0.0.0", () => console.log(`Listening on ${port}`));
```

* **`0.0.0.0` matters** on Replit.
* `process.env.PORT` should be honored if Replit injects it.

---

## If you’re running a separate client dev server (Vite/Next) too

Replit preview often expects **one** “main” port.

### Recommended for stability:

* Run **server on 5000**
* Serve built client **from the server** (static) so preview is always `:5000`

If you *are* running Vite, it might be on `5173` (or `3000`). If so:

* Either remove it from ports during debugging, **or**
* Map that port instead (but your current guidance says the app should be on 5000, so keep 5000 as the main preview).

---

## Quick sanity checks

* In Console logs: you should see **“Listening on 5000”** (or on whatever `PORT` is).
* Hit your health endpoint in-browser:
  `…/api/system/manifest` (or any known GET route)
  If that loads, the server is up and the preview mapping is the only problem.

---

## If it still won’t open

Paste **two things** and I’ll tell you exactly which case you’re in:

1. The last ~30 lines of your **Replit console logs**
2. What ports show up in the **Ports/Networking** panel after you clean them up (just the list)

That’ll let me pinpoint whether it’s (a) port mapping, (b) bind address, or (c) client dev-server confusion.
