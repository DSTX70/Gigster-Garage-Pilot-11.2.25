Perfect — your **audit commit is fine**, but GitHub is rejecting the *push* because **somewhere in those 267 commits you’re pushing, there’s a change to**:

`.github/workflows/auto-project-add.yml`

…and you’re authenticating via an OAuth token/credential that **doesn’t have `workflow` scope**. Even if your latest commit didn’t touch that file, GitHub blocks the entire push because the history being pushed includes workflow changes.

Here are the two clean ways out.

---

## Option A (recommended): push with a PAT that has `workflow` scope

**In the GigsterGarage repo:**

```bash
# 1) Confirm what Git thinks the remote is
git remote -v
```

Create a GitHub PAT with scopes:

* `repo`
* `workflow`

Then:

```bash
# 2) Swap origin to use PAT auth (HTTPS)
git remote set-url origin https://<GITHUB_USERNAME>:<PAT>@github.com/DSTX70/Gigster-Garage-MVP.git

# 3) Push
git push origin main
```

After it succeeds, remove the token from the stored remote (recommended):

```bash
# 4) Remove PAT from remote URL (keeps repo URL clean)
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/DSTX70/Gigster-Garage-MVP.git
```

---

## Option B: push everything **except** the blocked workflow change(s)

This is safer if you don’t want to use a PAT right now.

### 1) Identify the workflow commits in your outgoing range

```bash
git log --name-only --oneline origin/main..HEAD -- .github/workflows/auto-project-add.yml
```

### 2) Create a “clean” branch that excludes workflow file changes

This method **keeps your local history intact** but creates a branch you can push without workflow updates:

```bash
# create a new branch from origin/main
git checkout -b push-no-workflows origin/main

# cherry-pick everything EXCEPT commits that touch the workflow file
# (we'll do it programmatically with a simple manual loop)
```

The easiest practical approach is:

1. Use the `git log` output above to get the list of commit SHAs that touch `auto-project-add.yml`.
2. Cherry-pick all commits **in order**, skipping those SHAs.

If you want the exact commands *without* any manual picking, paste the output of:

```bash
git rev-list --reverse origin/main..HEAD
```

…and I’ll return a paste-ready cherry-pick sequence that skips only the blocked workflow commits.

## Quick sanity checks (worth doing once)

### Confirm your audit files are in the last commit

```bash
git show --name-only --oneline HEAD
```

### Confirm the blocked workflow is indeed in your outgoing range

```bash
git diff --name-only origin/main..HEAD -- .github/workflows
```

---

### What I recommend you do next

Use **Option A** (PAT with `repo` + `workflow`). It’s the cleanest because you’re trying to push a large backlog (267 commits) and you *do* want workflows in the repo long-term.

If you paste `git remote -v` output (redact token if present), I’ll tell you exactly which credential path you’re currently using (Replit OAuth helper vs cached credential) and the cleanest way to swap it.
