Got it — **A is the right move**.

Here’s the clean “Pods can audit + propose changes” setup for **Gigster Garage (GitHub repo = source of truth, Replit = execution lane)**.

## 1) Wire ChatGPT to that GitHub repo (read + cite)

1. In ChatGPT: **Settings → Connected apps → GitHub → Connect**
2. Authorize and **grant access only to the Gigster Garage repo**
3. In the chat, explicitly say:
   **“Use the GitHub connector and treat `<repo>` as canonical.”**

Result: the Pods can **read the current repo state**, reference exact files, and base audits on real code.

## 2) Confirm Replit is pointed at the *same* repo/branch

In Replit:

* Ensure the project was **imported from that GitHub repo**, or is **connected** to it.
* Make sure your deployment branch is defined (usually `main`), and Replit’s Git panel shows the same remote.
* Adopt a simple flow:

  * branch: `fix/<topic>`
  * PR into `main`
  * deploy from `main` (or your chosen deploy branch)

## 3) Install a “Pod-ready repo surface” (15-minute hygiene pack)

Drop these into the repo so every audit has a consistent home and every PR is structured.

### A) `.github/pull_request_template.md`

```md
## Summary
- What changed:

## Why
- User pain / bug / requirement:

## Screens / Evidence (if UI)
- Before:
- After:

## Files touched
- client:
- server:
- db:

## Test plan
- [ ] Smoke test: login
- [ ] Navigate to dashboard
- [ ] Admin-only route gating verified
- [ ] User Manual route reachable
- [ ] Regression: core flows still work

## Risk
- Low / Med / High (why)
```

### B) `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/audit_request.md`

```md
---
name: Pod Audit Request
about: Request an audit/review from Dream Team Pods
title: "[AUDIT] <Area>"
labels: ["audit"]
---

## Area
(UI/UX | Security | Performance | Data | Admin | Docs)

## Goal
What do you want improved?

## Constraints
No breaking changes / Keep current architecture / etc.

## Acceptance
What “done” looks like:
```

### C) `CODEOWNERS` (simple starter)

```txt
# Default
* @your-github-handle

# If you have teams later, you can route paths like:
# /server/  @backend-owners
# /client/  @frontend-owners
# /db/      @data-owners
```

### D) Create a `/dth/` folder for Pod governance

Add:

* `/dth/README.md` (what Pods are, how to request work)
* `/dth/decisions.md` (decision log)
* `/dth/audit_runs/` (timestamped audit outputs)

This keeps audits from scattering across issues/chats.

## 4) The “Pods Audit → Patch → Verify” loop (how we’ll run Gigster Garage)

**Step 1: Repo Intake**
You paste:

> “Run Gigster Garage Repo Intake. Build a repo map (client/server/db), find `/admin` + `/user-manual` routes (or absence), identify nav generation, and list hotspots + top 10 quick wins with file paths.”

**Step 2: Multi-lane audits**

* Lume: UX/nav discoverability + admin/manual entry points
* Forge/LexiCode: wiring completeness + route/API/data correctness
* Sentinel: admin gating + authorization boundaries
* Nova: UI consistency + component cleanup

**Step 3: Output format (what you’ll get every time)**

* Ranked findings
* Exact file targets
* Paste-ready patch blocks (or “diff-style” edits)
* Smoke test checklist

**Step 4: You apply via Replit**

* paste changes → run tests → commit/push → PR

**Step 5: Verify pass**

* Pods re-check the updated repo state and confirm acceptance criteria.

## 5) The only “activation message” you need to paste next

Paste this in the Gigster Garage thread when you’re ready to start:

> **Gigster Garage — GitHub Canonical Activation**
> Use the GitHub connector. Treat the GitHub repo backing the live Replit deployment as the single source of truth.
> First task: run **Repo Intake** and locate where `/admin` and `/user-manual` should be linked in the UI, and how admin-only visibility should be enforced in both UI and API. Output a ranked Quick Wins list plus the top 3 paste-ready patches.

When you paste that (and the GitHub connector is connected), I’ll immediately run the **Repo Intake** and we’ll generate the first **top-3 patches** (Admin entry point, Manual entry point, and RBAC enforcement) in the same format you’ve been handing to Replit.
