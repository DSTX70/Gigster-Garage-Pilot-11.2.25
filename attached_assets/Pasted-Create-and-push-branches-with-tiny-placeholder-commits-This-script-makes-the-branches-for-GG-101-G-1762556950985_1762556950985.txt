Create and push branches with tiny placeholder commits

This script makes the branches for GG-101..GG-103, adds a small owner-specific TODO note under docs/prs/, commits, and pushes.

If Replit asks for credentials, set your git username/email once:

git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "you@example.com"

2) Open the PRs on GitHub.com (UI)

Go to your repo → Compare & pull request for each branch:

feature/social-platform-adapters → choose forge template

feat/social-worker-scale → choose pulse template

ops/alerts-social-queue → choose sentinel template

Paste in any extra context you want, assign the owner, and submit.

(If you prefer CLI later, we can install gh and script it—but UI is quickest right now.)

What’s already ready to paste into each PR

You’ve got owner templates in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/… and we already shared the checkbox descriptions. When the PR opens, pick the right template from the dropdown; it’ll prefill everything.

After PRs are open (fast follow)

Run your enhanced checks (assumes services already up):

scripts/all_checks.sh --no-spawn --fast --only social


Drop the review checklist comment (I can generate those on request) onto each PR so reviewers know exactly what to verify.
