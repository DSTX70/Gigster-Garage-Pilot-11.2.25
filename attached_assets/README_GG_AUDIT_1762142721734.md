**Artifacts:** CSV matrices + PDF summary for repo/task manager.

## 📁 Files (drop these into your repo)
- **Feature Matrix (45 rows, detailed):** [`gg_audit_matrix.csv`](gg_audit_matrix.csv)
- **Scope Matrix (10 areas):** [`gg_scope_matrix.csv`](gg_scope_matrix.csv)
- **PDF Summary:** [`gg_audit_summary.pdf`](gg_audit_summary.pdf)

> Tip: In GitHub, place these under `/docs/audit/2025Q4/` and link from your main README.

## 📊 Snapshot (from PDF)
- Coverage status (approx): **Working ~42%**, **Partial ~58%**, **Broken 0%**, **Missing (named items) present in scope addendum**
- Overall Build Quality: **7.6 / 10**
- Pilot Readiness: **Yes** (with feature flags); Production after the priorities below.

## 🔝 Top 5 Priorities (create issues from these)
1) **Enforce Plans & Entitlements** — server‑side gating + upsell funnel  
2) **Ship 5 Agent Packs** — API + UI + DoD (Local Lift, Bookings, Shop Booster, Fundraiser, Portfolio‑to‑Pipeline)  
3) **Pods Marketplace + Sprint DoD + Billing** — start sprint → checklist → invoice line  
4) **Go‑Live Wizard** — intake → segment kit → connect payments + first channel → publish path to lead/checkout  
5) **Notifications/Webhooks Reliability** — outbox, retries/backoff, delivery dashboards
