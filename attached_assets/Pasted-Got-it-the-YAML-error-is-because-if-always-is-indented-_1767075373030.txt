Got it — the YAML error is because **`if: always()` is indented under the `run:` block** (or otherwise not aligned as a step key). In GitHub Actions YAML, `if:` must be at the **same indentation level as `name:` and `run:`** for that step.

Right now it looks like the `if: always()` ended up inside the previous step’s `run: |` area (or misaligned), which makes the whole file invalid.

Here’s a **clean patch drop** that fixes that whole section by rewriting the steps around line ~56 with correct indentation.

## Patch drop — fix YAML indentation around Debug + Pa11y steps

FILE: .github/workflows/website-audit.yml

```yaml
      - name: Lighthouse CI - assert
        run: |
          npx -y @lhci/cli assert --config=.lighthouserc.json || true

      - name: Lighthouse CI - upload (temporary public storage)
        run: |
          npx -y @lhci/cli upload --config=.lighthouserc.json --target=temporary-public-storage || true

      - name: Debug: list lighthouse output dir
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "Listing .lighthouseci (if present):"
          ls -la .lighthouseci || true

      - name: Install Pa11y (direct runner)
        run: |
          npm i --no-save pa11y

      - name: Run Pa11y (WCAG2AA) — outputs JSON report
        env:
          AUDIT_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.AUDIT_BASE_URL }}
        run: |
          echo "Running Pa11y (direct) against: ${AUDIT_BASE_URL}"
          node scripts/ci/run-pa11y.mjs "${AUDIT_BASE_URL}" > pa11y-report.json
          echo "Pa11y report saved to pa11y-report.json"
```

END_FILE

## Commit + push

```bash
git add .github/workflows/website-audit.yml
git commit -m "CI: fix website-audit.yml indentation (always() + Pa11y steps)"
git push origin main
```

## Then run it

GitHub → Actions → Website Audit → **Run workflow** (branch `main`)

You’ll know YAML is fixed when the workflow graph loads and the job actually starts.

If Pa11y still hits sandbox after this, we’ll handle it next — but first we need the workflow to parse.
