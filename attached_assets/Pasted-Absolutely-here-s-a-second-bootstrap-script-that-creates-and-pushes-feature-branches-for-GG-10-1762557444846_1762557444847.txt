Absolutely—here’s a **second bootstrap script** that creates and pushes feature branches for **GG-104 → GG-110**, each with a tiny placeholder commit so you can open PRs in the GitHub UI immediately.

Save and run this from your repo root in Replit:

```bash
mkdir -p scripts docs/prs
cat > scripts/bootstrap_pr_branches_104_110.sh <<'SH'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Ensure clean working tree
if ! git diff --quiet || ! git diff --cached --quiet; then
  echo "Please commit or stash your changes before running this."
  exit 1
fi

git fetch origin || true
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only || true

make_branch() {
  local branch="$1" file="$2" title="$3"
  git checkout -b "$branch"
  mkdir -p docs/prs
  {
    echo "# ${title}"
    echo
    echo "- Placeholder note to anchor initial PR for ${title}."
  } > "docs/prs/${file}"
  git add "docs/prs/${file}"
  git commit -m "${title}: seed PR placeholder"
  git push -u origin "$branch"
  git checkout main
}

SH

chmod +x scripts/bootstrap_pr_branches_104_110.sh
./scripts/bootstrap_pr_branches_104_110.sh
```

If git asks for identity the first time:

```bash
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "you@example.com"
```

### After running

* Go to GitHub → open PRs for each branch.
* Choose the corresponding owner template from `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`:

  * GG-104 → `switchboard.md`
  * GG-105 → `bridge.md` or `lume.md` (plus `codeblock.md` as needed)
  * GG-106 → `nova.md` (and `prism.md` if copy edits are included)
  * GG-107 → `verifier.md` (and `lume.md` for UX)
  * GG-108 → `ledger.md` (and `prism.md`/`foundry.md`)
  * GG-109 → `prism.md`, `storybloom.md`, `amani.md`
  * GG-110 → `ip_aegis_atlas_archivist_coda.md`

Want me to generate a quick **PR-open checklist** you can paste as a comment on each new PR (what reviewers should verify)?
