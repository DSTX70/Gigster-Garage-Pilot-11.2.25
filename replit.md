# Gigster Garage - Simplified Workflow Hub

## Overview

Gigster Garage is a comprehensive time tracker and workflow management system built with a full-stack TypeScript architecture. Its purpose is to provide a clean, intuitive interface for creating, managing, and tracking tasks with advanced features. Key capabilities include Custom Fields, Workflow Automation, Team Collaboration, AI-powered content generation, and an integrated Garage Assistant UI. The application features an enhanced invoice builder with auto-fill functionality and streamlined workflow automation, adhering to a monorepo structure with a React frontend, Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL database. The system follows a consistent Garage Navy branding. The business vision is to deliver a robust, intuitive, and efficient workflow hub, with market potential in professional services, small to medium-sized businesses, and individual freelancers seeking advanced productivity tools. The project ambitions include becoming a leading platform for integrated workflow management and intelligent task automation.

**Production Status**: All Phase 2 features are complete and production-ready, including Platform Connections UI, Advanced Monitoring Dashboard, and deployment configuration for autoscale publishing.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions

The application incorporates the Lume + Nova branding system with a carefully structured accent hierarchy:
- **Mint (#2EC5C2)**: Primary actions, progress bars, completed states
- **Navy (#0B1D3A)**: Selected/active states in filter pills, toggles, and navigation
- **Amber (#FFB52E)**: Reserved exclusively for Due Soon warnings
- **Red**: Overdue items only (thick 4px left borders + red text/icons)
- **Neutral grays**: Medium priority, on-hold status, non-urgent controls

Card emphasis follows Nova principles: only Overdue items use thick borders; all other cards use subtle 1px gray borders. Controls are quieter with shrunk segmented controls (h-9/h-7 with text-xs), neutral backgrounds, and tighter spacing.

The application features an enhanced invoice builder with auto-fill, a redesigned Workflow Automation page, and integrated Garage Assistant UI. Project dashboards include Kanban boards and Gantt chart timeline views, adapting to screen sizes. Recent enhancements include a global Command Palette (Cmd+K/Ctrl+K) for quick search and actions, a centralized Settings/Preferences page, a keyboard shortcuts guide (?), a floating Quick Action Button (FAB), an Offline Mode Indicator, and a reusable Empty States Component.

**Phase 2 Production Features**:
- **Platform Connections Page** (`/settings/connections`): User-friendly interface for managing social media API credentials (X/Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn) with save/delete/test functionality, secure credential input, and platform-specific setup instructions.
- **Advanced Monitoring Dashboard** (`/monitoring`): Real-time production monitoring with SLO metrics (error rate, queue age, rate limit saturation), queue statistics with visual charts, system health indicators, and configurable auto-refresh intervals (10s/30s/60s).
- **Deployment Configuration**: Autoscale deployment mode configured with build and run commands, ready for one-click publishing to production.

### Technical Implementations

The project is a full-stack TypeScript monorepo.
The frontend is built with React, using TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui for styling, TanStack Query for state management, Wouter for routing, and React Hook Form with Zod for form handling. Vite is used for building.
The backend uses Express.js with TypeScript in an ESM module setup, employing Drizzle ORM for database integration and Zod for shared validation schemas. It follows a RESTful API design.
Security features include a two-tier resource permission model (OWNED/SHARED), admin override capabilities, server-side recalculation of financial data to prevent tampering, and a three-tier plan enforcement model (Free, Pro, Enterprise) with feature gating via `requirePlan` middleware.

### System Design Choices

The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for its database, providing type safety and managed migrations. Authentication is session-based with bcrypt password hashing. The project uses npm for package management, Vite for development with hot module replacement, and ESLint/Prettier for code quality. A professional TypeScript client package (`@gigster-garage/api-client`) is available for API integration. Comprehensive demo materials, including an interactive HTML tutorial and an automated video demo, are provided for onboarding and training.

**Production Deployment**: Configured for autoscale deployment with build command `npm run build` and run command `npm run start`. All production monitoring, credential management, and social posting features are production-ready and tested. Comprehensive production guide available at `docs/PRODUCTION_READY_GUIDE.md`.
