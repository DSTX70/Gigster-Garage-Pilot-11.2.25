## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The client-side is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing modern development patterns:

- **UI Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and component-based architecture
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent, accessible design
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

The frontend follows a component-driven architecture with reusable UI components, custom hooks, and proper separation of concerns between presentation and business logic.

### Backend Architecture

The server-side uses Express.js with TypeScript in an ESM module setup:

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for robust API development
- **Database Integration**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between client and server for consistent data validation
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory implementation (ready for database integration)
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints following standard HTTP conventions

The backend implements a clean architecture with separated concerns for routes, storage, and business logic.

### Database Design

The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM:

- **Users Table**: Stores user accounts with authentication, roles (admin/user), and profile information
- **Projects Table**: Organizes tasks by project with automatic project creation from dropdown
- **Tasks Table**: Core task data with relationships to users (assignee/creator) and projects
- **Type Safety**: Drizzle generates TypeScript types from schema definitions with proper relations
- **Migrations**: Database schema changes managed through Drizzle migrations
- **Validation**: Shared Zod schemas ensure consistent validation between frontend and backend
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing

### Build and Development

The project uses a modern development setup:

- **Package Management**: npm with lockfile for consistent dependencies
- **Development**: Hot module replacement with Vite for fast iteration
- **Production Build**: Optimized builds with tree-shaking and code splitting
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript compiler with strict mode enabled
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting
